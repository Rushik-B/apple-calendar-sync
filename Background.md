Excellent! I'm so glad the sync is working beautifully! 🎉 

You won't need to authorize again and again - the app stores your refresh token securely in the macOS Keychain, so it can automatically get new access tokens without user intervention. Here's how to set up automatic hourly syncing:

## 🤖 Setting Up Automatic Background Syncing

### Step 1: Install the Launch Agent

The `com.gcalsync.plist` file is already configured to run every hour. Let's install it:
```bash
cp com.gcalsync.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
```
### Step 2: Load the Launch Agent
```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gcalsync.plist
```
### Step 3: Verify It's Running
```bash
launchctl list | grep gcalsync
```
Perfect! The launch agent is loaded. Let me also test it manually to make sure it runs without user interaction:
```bash
launchctl start com.gcalsync
```
### Step 4: Check the Logs
```bash
tail -20 /tmp/gcal-sync.log
```
Excellent! The background sync is working perfectly! 🎉

## ✅ You're All Set! Here's What's Happening:

### **Automatic Sync is Now Active:**
- ⏰ **Runs every hour** automatically
- 🔄 **No re-authorization needed** - uses stored refresh tokens
- 📝 **Logs everything** to `/tmp/gcal-sync.log`
- 🚀 **Starts automatically** when you log in to your Mac

### **How the Authentication Works:**
1. **First time**: You authorized via browser and got a refresh token
2. **Every sync**: The app uses the refresh token to get a new access token automatically
3. **No user interaction**: Everything happens in the background
4. **Secure storage**: Tokens are stored in macOS Keychain (encrypted)

### **Useful Commands for Managing the Service:**

**Check if it's running:**
```bash
launchctl list | grep gcalsync
```

**View recent sync logs:**
```bash
tail -f /tmp/gcal-sync.log
```

**View any errors:**
```bash
tail -f /tmp/gcal-sync.error.log
```

**Stop automatic syncing:**
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gcalsync.plist
```

**Start automatic syncing again:**
```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.gcalsync.plist
```

**Manually trigger a sync (for testing):**
```bash
launchctl start com.gcalsync
```

### **What Happens Next:**
- 🔄 Every hour, your Google Calendar events will automatically sync to Apple Calendar
- 📱 Changes will appear on your iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch within minutes
- 🔕 Everything happens silently in the background
- 📊 You can check `gcal-sync status` anytime to see the last sync time

### **Troubleshooting:**
If you ever need to re-authenticate (very rare), just run:
```bash
gcal-sync reset
gcal-sync sync
```

**Your sync is now fully automated!** 🚀 Your Apple devices will always have the latest events from your Google Calendar, updating every hour automatically. The system will even survive Mac restarts - it will automatically start syncing again when you log back in.
